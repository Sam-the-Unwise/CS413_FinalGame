# CS413_FinalGame


Final product for CS413 class at NAU

A simple game made with Pixi.js that involves being able to move around your character, shoot your laser, and battle the approaching hoard of zombies.

Warning, this game is very laggy so playing it on a regular computer will probably not work the best. A gaming computer will run it fine.
